# Pre Trained Models with PyTorch

Implemntation of using available pre trained networks from the PyTorch library. 

## Why?

This project follows chapter 2 from the book <i>Deep Learning With PyTorch</i>. I am practicing deep learning libraries in order to exercise my skills as a practitioner in the field.

## Training Set

The ILSVRC is used in this project for fine tuning pre trained models with additional data.
